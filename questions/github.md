# Github!
## What is the difference between Git and Github?
-  GitHub uses the email you set in your Git configuration to associate commits to your GitHub account. In Git, you can test if you have your email set by running git config --global user.email in your terminal. Hopefully you see the output what your email is set to.

## What is a pull request?

- A **pull request** allows you to collaborate with others on code that you have created on Github. You are able to discuss any changes, compare codes and fork any changes or suggestions over to your own profile.
