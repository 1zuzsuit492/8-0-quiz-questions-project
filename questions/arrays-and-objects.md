# Arrays and Objects!

## What is an array?

- An array allows you to store multiple values inside of a variable. An array will always contain square brackets []. However, arrays don’t always need to contain values. You can have an empty array and use different methods to add values to the array.

EXAMPLE: 
```js
const sweaterWeather = [50, 55, 60, 65]
```
- The array above displays that the variable ‘sweaterWeather’ is an array. The values inside of the array are numbers that represent the different temperatures in which it is appropriate to wear a sweater.
